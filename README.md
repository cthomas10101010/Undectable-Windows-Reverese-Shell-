Undetectable reverse shell for windows successfully bypassing windows defender
In this scenario the batch script is being deployed on a fully patched Windows 10 system over email and calling back to the attacker machine (ec2 instance running kali). 
The attacker sets up a net cat listener on port 443 (default port for HTTPS so more likely to look like normal web traffic to firewall).

After the script is run the windows 10 machine calls out to the attacker machine giving the attacker an initial foothold on the Windows machine to begin additional recon and lateral movement.  
Of course, in a real-life scenario an attacker would use social engineering and steganography or a similar technique to make the file appear normal.

Identifying the specific antivirus software deployed on the target system will be helpful in bypassing it. 
For example, if the antivirus software is only signature-based, then you just need to modify your payload to not match any of the signatures stored in the antivirus software catalog to bypass it. 
To evade behavior-based detection, consider what ports, protocols, and devices the target device overtly communicates with.  For example, a computer calling out to port 443 is rarely considered an anomaly because most web servers use port 443 for HTTPS. 

Taking the time to understand your target and combining several methods is most likely to prove successful.
Steganography: Embedding malware within seemingly innocuous files (e.g., images, audio, documents) to evade detection.
Code Obfuscation: Using techniques to obscure the true purpose and behavior of malware code, making it harder to analyze.
Encryption: Encrypting malware payloads and communication channels to prevent detection by security tools.
Exploiting Legitimate Services: Leveraging legitimate software or services to execute malicious actions, making detection more challenging.
Living off the Land: Leveraging built-in system utilities and legitimate software for malicious purposes to blend in with normal system activity.
